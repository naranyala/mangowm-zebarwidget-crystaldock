# Getting Started with OCWS

This guide covers installation, first-run usage, and troubleshooting for OCWS -- a Wayland desktop shell built on labwc, sfwbar, and fuzzel using only C and GTK3.

---

## Architecture Overview

OCWS is built on four layers:

| Layer | Component | Role |
|-------|-----------|------|
| Compositor | labwc | Wayland session, window management, input, keybindings |
| Shell UI | sfwbar | GTK3 panel engine: widgets, tray, taskbar, popups |
| Launcher | fuzzel | App launcher and dmenu-mode script runner |
| Layer Shell | gtk-layer-shell | Anchors shell surfaces to Wayland outputs |

Supporting services: ocws-notify (notifications), swayidle + swaylock (idle/lock), cliphist + wl-clipboard (clipboard), playerctl (media), ocws-brightness (backlight), gammastep (night light), grim + slurp (screenshots).

---

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

On Arch Linux:

```bash
sudo pacman -S labwc sfwbar fuzzel gtk-layer-shell pipewire wireplumber libpulse \
  inotify-tools playerctl bc wl-clipboard cliphist \
  polkit-gnome swayidle swaylock grim slurp foot tesseract leptonica
```

On Debian/Ubuntu or Fedora, see `distro/debian.sh` and `distro/fedora.sh`.

To compile the latest upstream versions from source:

```bash
./build-ocws-core.sh all
```

### Step 2: Run the Installer

```bash
git clone https://github.com/naranyala/labwc-fuzzel-sfwbar.git
cd labwc-fuzzel-sfwbar
./install.sh
```

The installer:

1. Checks system dependencies
2. Backs up any existing ~/.config/labwc/ and ~/.config/ocws/
3. Deploys dotfiles/labwc/ to ~/.config/labwc/
4. Deploys dotfiles/ocws/ to ~/.config/ocws/
5. Deploys dotfiles/fuzzel/ to ~/.config/fuzzel/
6. Deploys GTK settings to ~/.config/gtk-3.0/ and ~/.config/gtk-4.0/
7. Links all scripts from scripts/ to ~/.local/bin/
8. Links action scripts from scripts/actions/ to ~/.local/bin/actions/
9. Installs built C binaries from zig-out/bin/ to ~/.local/bin/

### Step 3: Launch the Session

From a display manager (GDM, SDDM, ly): log out and select labwc.

From a TTY:

```bash
labwc
```

## Installed File Layout

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| ~/.config/labwc/ | rc.xml, menu.xml, autostart, environment, themerc-override |
| ~/.config/ocws/ | ocws.config, *.widget, ocws-daemon.sh, plugins/, state.kv |
| ~/.config/fuzzel/ | fuzzel.ini |
| ~/.config/foot/ | foot.ini |
| ~/.local/bin/ | All scripts/*.sh and C helper binaries (ocws-*) |
| ~/.local/bin/actions/ | All scripts/actions/*.sh |

---

## What Starts at Boot

~/.config/labwc/autostart runs automatically when labwc starts. Key services launched:

| Service | Command | Role |
|---------|---------|------|
| Wallpaper | ocws-wallpaper ~/Pictures/wallpapers/ | Time-of-day wallpaper transitions |
| Shell UI | sfwbar | Native GTK3 OCWS Interface |
| OCWS Daemon | ~/.config/ocws/ocws-daemon.sh | Event Bus IPC listener |
| Notifications | ocws-notify | D-Bus notification daemon (replaces mako) |
| Clipboard | wl-paste --watch cliphist store | Clipboard history daemon |
| Idle/Lock | swayidle -w timeout 300 'swaylock -f' | Auto-lock after 5 min |
| Night light | gammastep -t 6500:3500 -g 1.0 -r | Day/night color temp |

---

## Default Keybindings

Keybindings are defined in ~/.config/labwc/rc.xml.

### Application Keybindings

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Super+Enter | Launch terminal (foot) |
| Super+D | Launch app launcher (fuzzel) |
| Super+V | Open clipboard history (cliphist + fuzzel) |
| Super+Q | Close focused window |
| Super+F | Toggle fullscreen |

### Workspace Keybindings

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Super+1-9 | Switch to workspace 1-9 |
| Super+Shift+1-9 | Move window to workspace 1-9 |
| Alt+Tab | Cycle through windows |

### System Keybindings

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| XF86AudioRaiseVolume | Volume up |
| XF86AudioLowerVolume | Volume down |
| XF86AudioMute | Toggle mute |
| XF86MonBrightnessUp | Brightness up |
| XF86MonBrightnessDown | Brightness down |
| Print | Screenshot region to file |
| Super+Print | Screenshot fullscreen to file |
| Shift+Print | Screenshot region to clipboard |

## Using the Shell

### Shell Modes

OCWS provides multiple desktop paradigms through its modular configuration. You can switch between them on the fly:

```bash
# Interactive UI
shell-mode-picker.sh

# CLI
toggle-shell doublepanel   # OCWS dual-panel (default)
toggle-shell crystaldock   # sfwbar statusbar + crystal-dock
toggle-shell minimal       # minimal sfwbar (clock, volume, battery)
toggle-shell dms           # DankMaterialShell
toggle-shell noctalia      # Noctalia shell
```

Or use the graphical settings app:

```bash
ocws-settings
```

### Control Center

Click the clock or system tray area on the panel to open the OCWS Control Center popup. It includes volume, brightness, battery, WiFi, Bluetooth, and media controls.

### Application Launcher

Press Super+D or click the launcher button in the panel to open fuzzel. Start typing to fuzzy-search installed apps.

### Theme Switching

```bash
# List available themes
theme-engine.sh list

# Preview a theme (live preview, reverts on Ctrl+C)
theme-engine.sh preview themes/catppuccin-mocha.ini

# Apply permanently
theme-engine.sh apply themes/catppuccin-mocha.ini
```

Available themes in themes/:
catppuccin-mocha, tokyo-night, dracula, nord, rose-pine, gruvbox, everforest, kanagawa, one-dark, solarized-dark, flexoki

### Smooth Hardware Control

All hardware controls use animated transitions (cubic easing):

```bash
ocws-brightness set 50    # Smooth fade to 50%
ocws-brightness up        # +5% with animation
ocws-volume set 75        # Smooth fade to 75%
ocws-volume up            # +5% with animation
```

---

## Verifying the Installation

```bash
# Check core binaries are in PATH
which labwc sfwbar fuzzel foot ocws

# Check OCWS config directories exist
ls ~/.config/ocws/
ls ~/.config/labwc/

# Check C helper binaries are installed
ls ~/.local/bin/ocws

# Test the Event Bus
ocws-emit.sh System.Volume 75
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### sfwbar panel does not start

```bash
# Run sfwbar manually to see errors
sfwbar -f ~/.config/ocws/ocws.config

# Check for missing widget includes
grep -r 'Include\|Scanner' ~/.config/ocws/ocws.config
```

### labwc will not start / black screen

```bash
# Debug labwc directly
debug-labwc.sh

# Or run with verbose output from TTY
labwc 2>&1 | tee /tmp/labwc.log
```

### Theme not applying

```bash
theme-engine.sh list
theme-engine.sh apply themes/catppuccin-mocha.ini
# Then reload labwc
labwc --reconfigure
```

### Clipboard history empty

```bash
# Ensure cliphist daemon is running
pgrep -a wl-paste
# If not running, start it
wl-paste --type text/plain --watch cliphist store &
```

### Volume/brightness keys not working

```bash
# Test scripts directly
~/.local/bin/actions/audio.sh up
~/.local/bin/actions/brightness.sh up

# Verify keybinds in rc.xml
grep -A3 'XF86Audio\|XF86MonBrightness' ~/.config/labwc/rc.xml
```
